The average lifespan is increasing every year as medicine progresses, but we all would love to live a bit longer, still. 

These 5 things may sound obvious, and you probably heard about the advantages of all of them, but when I tell you that doing these things can prolong your lifespan by <span class='font-bold'>MORE THAN 14 YEARS</span> on average, maybe you will take them more seriously than before. 

 ## 1. Smoking 

We’ve all heard how terrible smoking is for our health, but did you know how many years you can actually add to your life by quitting? 

A study by the New England Journal of Medicine has found that even if you are 64, quitting smoking can add <span class='font-bold'>up to 4 years</span> to your life!! That is a lot of extra time to enjoy your retirement if you ask me. 

People who quit at age 34 can <span class='font-bold'>live a decade longer</span> than if they keep smoking. 10 whole years! To me, those are some crazy numbers. 

The study found that smokers were only <span class='font-bold'>half as likely</span> to reach the age of 80 as non-smokers. This is mostly due to the fact that a big percentage of smokers die of smoke-related illnesses concerning the lungs and the heart. 

And if you haven’t started smoking in the first place, keep it up and keep these numbers in mind, should you ever feel tempted.

 ## 2. Nutrition 

Nutrition is important for our health. But how important is it really when it comes to our lifespan? 

Of course, a perfect diet will not guarantee great health and longevity, but your chances will be substantially higher. 

Studies have shown that people in their 70s and 80s can <span class='font-bold'>lower their risk of heart disease</span>, simply by changing their diets, so it is never too late. 

<span class='font-bold'>17.7 million people</span> die of heart disease every year. A significant part of these deaths could have been prevented by proper nutrition throughout their life. 

### <span class='font-bold'>Which diet should you follow?</span> 

There are countless opinions out there on which diet is best for you long-term. Which diet is best for you will depend on your lifestyle and body, but numerous studies have proven that  <a href="https://fullyholistic.com/posts/Sugar"><ins>decreasing added sugar</ins></a> and <span class='font-bold'>focusing on plant-based food</span> will lead you on a healthier path. 

A lot of scientists also believe in the benefits of the <span class='font-bold'>Mediterranean Diet</span>, which consists of mainly plant-based foods (olive oil, whole grains, vegetables, legumes, fresh fruit, nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices), a moderate amount of fish, poultry and dairy, and low consumption of red meat, sugar, and pastries. 

A long-term study has shown that sticking to this diet has <span class='font-bold'>decreased overall mortality by 9%</span>, death from cardiovascular disease by 9%, and mortality from cancer by 6%. 

### <span class='font-bold'>General Guidelines to follow for a healthy diet: </span>

<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Focus on <span class='font-bold'>whole, unprocessed foods</span> - prepare as much as you can yourself 
<li>Limit <span class='font-bold'>processed</span>, ready-to-eat food 
<li>Try to <span class='font-bold'>decrease added sugar</span> in foods you eat
<li>Eat <span class='font-bold'>balanced  meals</span>, get some variety of protein and vegetables
<li>Drink <span class='font-bold'>more water</span> 
</ul>


### <span class='font-bold'>Fasting </span>

Intermittent fasting is another factor that might prove useful when trying to prolong your lifespan. 

Valter Longo, one of the world’s leading longevity scientists published  <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27810402/"><ins>a review</ins></a> in which he said, that Intermittent Fasting improved <span class='font-bold'>several aspects of age-related diseases in humans</span>. 
Studies included in his review showed that IF can protect against type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 

<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31881139/"><ins>Another review</ins></a> was published by The New England Journal of Medicine, that showed similar results, linking IF to a <span class='font-bold'>lower risk of many health conditions</span> and age-related diseases like diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, cancers, and neurological disorders.

 ## 3. Move 

Most of us are aware that we should be moving more. Or if we already are, we know how good it is for us. 

Regular physical activity can <span class='font-bold'>reduce chronic diseases</span> like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and some types of cancer. 

On top of that, it will help you <span class='font-bold'>live independently</span> for a longer period of time. You will stay more mobile, flexible, and active as you age. 

### <span class='font-bold'>How much should you move?</span>

A popular recommendation is <span class='font-bold'>at least 30 minutes</span> of moderate physical activity most days of the week or <span class='font-bold'>20 minutes</span> of vigorous activity at least three times a week. 

How you choose to go about moving is your choice. Maybe a walk in a nearby park will be fun for you, or you discover a new love for riding your bicycle. 

Here is a list of <span class='font-bold'>moderate activities:</span> 
<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Walking at a fast pace
<li>Raking leaves
<li>Mowing your grass
<li>Riding your bike leisurely 
<li>Swimming for fun
<li>Playing golf 

</ul>

Basically anything you can do while being able to <span class='font-bold'>carry on a conversation</span> with little activity (so you’re not terribly out of breath) 

Examples of <span class='font-bold'>vigorous activity</span> could be: 
<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Running
<li>Swimming laps
<li>Playing tennis
<li>Dancing
</ul>

So, in contrast, anything that will <span class='font-bold'>get your heart rate up</span>, make it hard to talk and cause you to sweat! 

Try to keep a balance between
<ul class="list-disc">
<li><span class='font-bold'>Aerobic activities (cardio)</span> - these will burn calories, and strengthen your heart and lungs. 
<li><span class='font-bold'>Resistance Training or Strength training </span> (like body-weight exercises or lifting weights) - these will strengthen the muscles in your legs, arms, chest, and stomach. 
<li><span class='font-bold'>Balance and Stretching </span>- this will reduce your risk of injury with the other two activities and will help maintain flexibility, range of motion, and posture! 

</ul>

 ## 4. Stress 

You might know that stress is not good for our overall health, but did you know it can have a significant impact on your lifespan? 

A study published in the journal "BMJ Open", in which researchers from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare calculated the effects of multiple risk factors, including lifestyle-related ones, on the life expectancy of men and women, found that heavy stress <span class='font-bold'>shortens the life expectancy of 30-year-old men by 2.8 years!</span> 

### <span class='font-bold'>How can you reduce stress? </span> 

I will write a more detailed post about ways to effectively reduce stress, but here are a few ways to relax more in your daily life: 

<ul class="list-disc">
<li><span class='font-bold'>Deep Breathing exercises</span> : this will allow you to regulate your nervous system through your breath! 
<li><span class='font-bold'>Meditation</span> : Not only will you gain a few mindful minutes throughout your day, but you will also get a clearer insight on your thoughts and problems, and might find solutions you wouldn’t have thought of otherwise. 
<li><span class='font-bold'>Counseling</span> : Sometimes talking to a professional can help to recognize and release stress, as well as finding healthy coping mechanisms. 
<li><span class='font-bold'>Movement</span> : Exercise has been proven to reduce stress. On top of that it will lower your risk of physical illness, so it’s a win-win! 
<li><span class='font-bold'>Journaling</span> : Making a habit of writing about your thoughts and feelings can be a great outlet to reduce stress. 
</ul>

 ## 5. Sleep 

A lot of us are guilty of getting insufficient amounts of sleep. Maybe these facts will help you switch off Netflix a bit earlier in the future.

Sleep is often viewed as a luxury and limiting the hours we sleep can sometimes feel worth it. But people often overlook the long-term health risks of insufficient sleep. 

Medical conditions such as <span class='font-bold'>obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease</span> , as well as immune function, and colds are linked to the amount of sleep you get. 

The science on this topic is still in its beginnings, but experts have found that enough high-quality sleep might be <span class='font-bold'>just as important to your health as nutrition and exercise</span> . 

### How to sleep more and better

<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Make sleeping a <span class='font-bold'>priority</span> 
<li>Have a <span class='font-bold'>nighttime routine</span>  that prepares your mind and body for sleeping at a certain time
<li>Reduce <span class='font-bold'>blue light exposure</span>  in the evening (and wear blue light glasses throughout the day when exposed to technology) 
<li>Don’t drink <span class='font-bold'>caffeine</span>  late in the day 
<li>Try to have a <span class='font-bold'>consistent sleep and wake time</span> 
<li>Reduce <span class='font-bold'>daytime naps</span>  
<li>Take <span class='font-bold'>melatonin</span>  supplements 
<li><span class='font-bold'>Relax</span>  and clear your mind in the evening 
<li><span class='font-bold'>Exercise </span> regularly (but not right before bed) 
</ul>
