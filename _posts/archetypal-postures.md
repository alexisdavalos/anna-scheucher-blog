Back Pain is something a lot of people struggle with, especially now that our lifestyles are becoming more and more sedentary. Covid and the sudden switch to home offices, mostly without ergonomic office chairs at our disposal, did not help this issue. But you will be pleased to know that you do not need a $500+ chair in order to do something good for your back.

Whether you’re here because you are currently suffering from pain (if that is the case, I am sincerely sorry and I will write a post on how to deal with acute pain soon), or whether you randomly stumbled upon this post and are looking for ways of prevention, I will give you a few handy tips on how to prevent back pain based on how our primal ancestors went about their days.

## What have our ancestors got to do with our back pain?

That’s a valid question. Although our modern lifestyles barely resemble the day-to-day of our ancestors back in the Stone Age, our physicality stayed more or less the same. In short, our bodies were not built for the chairs, sofas and couches we tend to spend most of our time in nowadays.

This results in less-than-ideal postures while sitting, putting pressure on all the wrong body parts for way too long at a time. Have you ever sat on the floor and found yourself shifting positions every few minutes because you got too uncomfortable?

What seems like a nuisance is in fact a perfect example of our body noticing the effects of a certain posture and changing it before we spend enough time in it to do any serious damage.

The fact that chairs and couches seem to get more and more comfortable as the years go by might seem great at first, but essentially all that cushioning drowns out your body’s need to shift and move constantly. You could never sit on the floor comfortably in a single position for hours, the way you do in a chair.

In order to adjust our lifestyle to what is ideal for our physique, we have to take a closer look at which postures and movements were the basis of how our bodies are built to begin with.

## What are Archetypal Postures?

Archetypal Postures are the primal human postures that are essentially embedded in our biology, like our joints and muscles.

Inherent primal human movements are for example:

<ul class="list-disc">
    <li>Walking
    <li>Kneeling
    <li>Squatting 
    <li>Sitting on the ground
</ul>

In order to ideally prevent back pain (as well as take advantage of numerous other benefits), you should try to implement these primal movements as much as possible in your day-to-day.

Let’s take a look at each of these in more detail:

## The benefits of Walking

It comes as no surprise to anyone that walking is good for us. It is the activity our bodies are literally designed to do.

But other than that, walking brings a lot of benefits to the table:

<ul class="list-disc">
<li><span class='font-bold'>Movement:</span> Moving our body is always good, especially in our primarily sedentary lifestyles. Our primal ancestors moved almost all day long, and our basic biology craves the same from us

<li><span class='font-bold'>Improved Circulation:</span> When we walk, our circulation benefits highly. It helps to ward off heart disease, lowers your blood pressure and strengthens your heart.

<li><span class='font-bold'>Stronger bones:</span> walking can help stop the loss of bone mass for those with osteoporosis. It also helps with general bone density, according to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8304358/"><ins>this study</ins></a>

<li><span class='font-bold'>Longer Life:</span> Not only will your life be potentially more pain-free, it might also be prolonged by regular walking! According to <a href="https://www.cancer.org/research/population-science/cancer-prevention-and-survivorship-research-team/acs-cancer-prevention-studies/cancer-prevention-study-2.html"><ins>the American Cancer Society</ins></a>, regular walking may reduce the risk of different types of cancer and in turn potentially prolong your lifespan.

<li><span class='font-bold'>Improved Mood:</span> walking brings us the mood-boosting endorphins connected with any type of exercise. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5015672/"><ins>A study</ins></a> has proven that an increased number of steps every day not only boosted the participant’s mood, it also reduced their anxiety, depression, fatigue, anger and confusion!
</ul>

These are just a few of the many benefits of walking, to name them all would be a post in and of itself.

In short, walking is great for you and incorporating even short walks into your daily life will help you to be more active and prevent back pain through movement and increased blood flow to your muscles (which will in turn help to resolve knots and tightnesses)

## The benefits of kneeling

What is the history of kneeling? Kneeling is ingrained in your body’s nervous system. It’s what we did as little babies, before we learned to squat, stand and walk.

In order to prevent back pain, kneeling at your desk instead of sitting or standing might be the option to go with!

Apart from being a natural position for you body, it bears these other advantages as well:

<ul class="list-disc">

<li>Naturally <span class='font-bold'>demands your core</span> (the more you narrow your legs, the more it will demand your core to stabilize - get an added ab workout in your work day!)

<li><span class='font-bold'>Activates and improves muscles</span> you are not used to use in everyday life

<li>Half kneeling (one leg down and one leg forward) will automatically put your<span class='font-bold'> spine and pelvis in a neutral form</span>

<li>It will force you to <span class='font-bold'>be more upright</span> and therefore improve your posture

<li>Forces you to <span class='font-bold'>move and shift more</span> (as mentioned in the introduction of this post)

<li>Any benefit you would get from <span class='font-bold'>standing</span>

<li><span class='font-bold'>It’s FREE</span> - no need for equipment, a professional, a new desk - it works with what you already have at your disposal! 
</ul>

## The benefits of squatting

Another one - and one of my favorite postures - is squatting. And no, I’m not (just) talking about the famous exercise you do at the gym to get thiccer (lol)

The full squat refers to the position where your knees are flexed and your thighs touch your calves while the heels remain flat on the floor.

You can watch young children naturally refer back to this position when they pick something up from the floor or simply as an alternative to sitting.

If you try this out and you can’t seem to keep your balance or place your heels on the ground, don’t worry! This might just mean the muscles necessary for this position are not flexible enough anymore!

Try turning your toes outward, raising your heels or holding on to something until you improve your mobility!

When performed correctly, the full squat offers a lot of health benefits.

In terms of back pain, this Full Squat puts us in a perfectly neutral position with no pressure at all on the spine. All the force gets absorbed by your muscles in your legs. This will encourage better posture, stronger muscles and less wear and tear on the spine.

On top of that, your pelvis will be tipped back, therefore elongating your spine and giving it a much needed stretch after all the compression of sitting in a chair.

Other benefits of squatting include:

<ul class="list-disc">
<li><span class='font-bold'>Ankle Mobility:</span> as you practice your full squat, your heels will eventually sit flat on the floor, giving you a great range of ankle flexibility. This in turn can help with bad posture - so another win against back pain!

<li><span class='font-bold'>Glute strengthening:</span> We have all probably heard of how squats help us build our Glutaeus Maximus muscle (aka your butt). Coming in and out of a full squat is one of the best ways to train that muscle, and it will in turn help stabilize your entire body.

<li>All of these benefits will result in an improvement of both your <span class='font-bold'>static and dynamic posture</span>. This will do big things in preventing back pain in the future, so maybe consider squatting down more often while you work. 
</ul>

Working at a coffee table has proven very useful for me when implementing most of these strategies!

## The benefits of sitting on the ground

I already touched on some benefits of sitting on the ground at the beginning of this post (frequent change of position,...), and technically both kneeling and squatting also fall into this category. However, sitting on the ground brings a list of additional benefits that might not be so obvious at first and after reading through them you might have a better idea of why you should sit on the ground more often!

<ul class="list-disc">

<li><span class='font-bold'>Stability:</span> Just like with kneeling or squatting, your core is engaged a lot more when sitting on the ground as opposed to a chair.

<li><span class='font-bold'>Hip tension:</span> one of the biggest problems of sitting in a chair is how tight our hip flexor muscles become. Sitting on the ground allows you to easily stretch them throughout the day and by switching positions frequently.

<li><span class='font-bold'>Flexibility:</span> sitting on the ground will automatically improve your range of motion. Most positions will require a passive stretch of some of your lower body muscles, in turn giving you a lot more flexibility in the long run!

<li><span class='font-bold'>Mobility:</span> This ties in with the point about flexibility, the more flexible you become, the greater your mobility will be!

<li><span class='font-bold'>Muscle Activity:</span> just like kneeling and squatting, sitting on the ground will also count towards active rest. You need a lot more muscle activity to sit in these positions as opposed to a chair for example.
</ul>

## Conclusion

Whether you want to prevent back pain or simply life a more balanced, active life, implementing Primal Movements and Archetypal Postures into your everyday life will bring you lots of benefits.

Of course you don’t have to go and throw out your chair and implement every single of these points immediately, but maybe try to keep them in the back of your head to use in short intervals throughout your day.

A few tips to start using Primal Movements today:

<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Get up from your desk at least every hour to walk, even if it is just a few steps. Set an alarm if you need to.

<li>Try to see how you can (realistically) get as much walking into your everyday life as possible. I’m thinking stairs instead of elevator, walking to the store around the corner instead of taking the car, walking around the house for 15 minutes while being on social media/ reading in your downtime.

<li>Define a timespan that works for you and then set a timer to use Archetypal Postures. For example: Every hour, set a 10 minute timer to squat at your desk instead of sitting. Increase time/frequency as you get more used to it. 
</ul>
