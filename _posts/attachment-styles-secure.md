After <a href="https://fullyholistic.com/posts/attachment-styles-introduction"><ins> last week's introduction</ins></a>, we are starting our journey to dive into the different attachment styles by taking a closer look at <span class='font-bold'>Secure Attachment. </span>

## What is Secure Attachment? 
Secure Attachment is the type of Attachment <span class='font-bold'>we all strive for.</span> You can take the Attachment Style Quiz every few months and see the percentages change. Ideally, <span class='font-bold'>the more you heal over time, the bigger the percentage of “Secure Attachment” will get. </span>

Having a predominantly Secure Attachment Style means that you are <span class='font-bold'>not avoidant and not very anxious. You are okay and comfortable with intimacy and aren’t too worried about being rejected. </span>

I want to mention here that <span class='font-bold'>nobody is ever 100% secure.</span> Being anxious, getting worried about what other people think, not wanting to be rejected - these are all <span class='font-bold'>very human things</span> and you can’t get rid of them completely (sorry). The goal is not to never feel insecure again, the goal is to <span class='font-bold'>learn to accept the natural feelings as they arise (and learn how to healthily cope with them) </span>and at the same time noticing the irrational reactions that might stem from a core belief / traumatic experience and healing to the point where these triggers stabilize. 

## What are the characteristics of Secure Attachment? 

The <span class='font-bold'>characteristics of Secure Attachment </span>are the following: 

<ul class="list-disc">
<li>You can <span class='font-bold'>depend on a partner,</span> while also allowing them to <span class='font-bold'>depend on you. </span>
<li>You’re <span class='font-bold'>available for your partner</span> in times of need. 
<li>You are comfortable in a <span class='font-bold'>loving and emotionally close relationship</span>
<li>You are <span class='font-bold'>forgiving, trusting, tolerant (of differences), and empathic </span>
<li>You <span class='font-bold'>accept your partner’s need for alone time </span>without getting the feeling of rejection or feeling threatened. 
<li>You can be <span class='font-bold'>close and independent </span>
<li>You can <span class='font-bold'>communicate your needs and emotions</span> openly 
<li>You <span class='font-bold'>do not avoid conflict </span>
<li>You are <span class='font-bold'>in tune to your partner’s needs </span>and respond to them lovingly 
<li>You practice <span class='font-bold'>forgiveness and try to gain insight</span> from past relationships and times you got hurt 
<li>You <span class='font-bold'>manage your emotions</span> well 
<li>As a parent, you are <span class='font-bold'>caring, warm and sensitive.</span> You respond to your child’s needs and your children are also securely attached. 
</ul>

## What if Secure Attachment is my predominant Attachment Style?

If that is the case, that’s awesome! Having a predominantly secure attachment style is the key to a balanced and healthy life! 

### Ways to get more secure: 

<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Become more <span class='font-bold'>mindful and conscious</span> about your thoughts, triggers, and emotional reactions. Check out <a href="https://fullyholistic.com/posts/valid-feelings"><ins> this post</ins></a> to learn how to cope with that! 

<li>Reflect on the worst things that have happened to you in the past, and see <span class='font-bold'>what they taught you and how they changed you for the better </span>

<li>When feeling insecure, try to <span class='font-bold'>pinpoint what is causing it. </span>Think of your attachment style and if that might have something to do with it. Awareness is the first step to change. 

<li>Work on <span class='font-bold'>Self-Love. </span>It sounds cheesy, but self-love really is the basis of everything. And by that, I don’t mean just bubble baths and face-masks, but truly take the time to work on yourself. The more you are comfortable with yourself, your emotions, and your shadows, <span class='font-bold'>the more you can embrace them and feel less insecure! </span>
</ul>

## Work with what you have 

Even if you are predominantly secure in your attachment, there will be days where life feels overwhelming, and that's okay. 

If you don't resonate with secure attachment at all, that's okay, too! By becoming more aware of your reactions and emotions, you will start to heal. 

The more you heal, the healthier your relationships will be in the future! 

Look out for the next posts on how to heal and grow from the other types of attachment styles!
