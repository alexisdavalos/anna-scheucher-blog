In this part of the Attachment Style Series, we’re taking a closer look at the <span class='font-bold'>avoidant attachment.</span> This attachment style is also referred to as <span class='font-bold'>dismissive attachment. </span>

For a general introduction or a closer look at the other attachment styles, check out my other posts! 

## What is Avoidant Attachment? 
When you are primarily avoidantly attached, this means, surprise, surprise - you’re very avoidant. People with a predominantly avoidant attachment style tend to <span class='font-bold'>not be very anxious,</span> and instead, feel very <span class='font-bold'>uncomfortable with closeness.</span> They value their independence and freedom over everything. Oftentimes this attachment style comes with the <span class='font-bold'>inability to trust others,</span> let alone depend on them. 

In relationships, this can mean that their partners would like them to be <span class='font-bold'>more vulnerable and intimate</span> than what they are comfortable with. 

## Where does Avoidant Attachment come from? 
Avoidant Attachment often develops in <span class='font-bold'>early childhood. </span>When children <span class='font-bold'>do not receive sensitive responses to their needs</span> from their parents or caretakers, this can increase the likelihood of developing a predominantly avoidant attachment style. 

Children rely on their parents to have their needs met. When this desire for closeness is repeatedly rejected, it can cause the child to <span class='font-bold'>suppress their need for comfort when they are upset or distressed. </span>

They might also learn to <span class='font-bold'>self-soothe,</span> and develop the idea that <span class='font-bold'>they can only rely on themselves in times of need.</span> Because of that, they find it incredibly difficult to ask for help or support form others. 

This type of attachment style can cause <span class='font-bold'>serious difficulties when trying to form close relationships later in life. </span>

## What are the Characteristics of Avoidant Attachment? 
The <span class='font-bold'>characteristics of predominantly avoidantly attached people</span> are: 

<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Don’t like to <span class='font-bold'>talk about their emotions,</span> <span class='font-bold'>avoid conflict until it builds up,</span> and then they explode with pent-up feelings 
<li>Withdraw in difficult situations and try to <span class='font-bold'>cope alone </span>
<li>Feel like partners are <span class='font-bold'>clingy, </span>when they simply want to get emotionally closer 
<li>Have feelings of <span class='font-bold'>high self-esteem </span>while viewing others <span class='font-bold'>negatively</span>
<li>Value their independence, <span class='font-bold'>can’t depend on a partner</span> or let their partner fully depend on them
<li>Intimacy signals a <span class='font-bold'>loss of independence</span> to them, so they prefer being alone
<li>Focus only on <span class='font-bold'>their own needs and comforts</span>, neglecting those around them
<li>Very <span class='font-bold'>self-sufficient, stoic, controlled</span>
<li>Emotionally distant, <span class='font-bold'>avoiding intimate relationships,</span> and if in relationships, keep partner at arm’s length 
<li>Non-emotional, and <span class='font-bold'>reacts well in times of crisis </span>
<li>As parents, <span class='font-bold'>not attached and emotionally unavailable, </span>children tend to also develop avoidant attachments 
</ul>

## How can you prevent an avoidant attachment style? 
To prevent your child from developing a primarily avoidant attachment style, it is important to be <span class='font-bold'>open and sensitive to their needs and feelings,</span> while motivating them to express their emotions and wishes. 

The parent should also let the child know that <span class='font-bold'>they are safe and that they care for them, both, through their words and their actions. </span>

When a parent feels like they have difficulties fulfilling their children’s needs, and are at a loss with parenting, there are coaches or mental health professionals who specialize in helping with exactly that.

## How can I heal my avoidant attachment? 
If you feel like you have a predominantly avoidant attachment style and are wondering how to heal from it to become more securely attached, there are many things that can help you! 

First of all, congratulations on taking the most important step, which is <span class='font-bold'>awareness and a willingness to change.</span> This is the biggest obstacle for many. 

<span class='font-bold'>Therapy, counseling, or coaching</span> can all be great options for learning how to heal. 

If you want to try to work on it yourself, <span class='font-bold'>Inner Child Healing can do wonders. The important thing when healing from avoidant attachment is that you understand <span class='font-bold'>how your parents responded to your needs as a child</span> and how this has <span class='font-bold'>shaped your current emotions or patterns.</span> Inner Child Healing allows you to do exactly that. Not only will it bring awareness to memories that might have been suppressed, but it will also show you how to work through those things and grow from them. 

Explaining Inner Child Healing would go into a whole other post (and I might do one in the future), but if you are interested, <span class='font-bold'>send me an  <a class="text-gray-700  font-bold hover:underline hover:text-blue-500 duration-200 transition-colors" href="mailto:ascheucher.healing@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Email</a> with the subject line “Inner Child Healing” and I will provide you with some helpful resources that allowed me to dive into this topic. </span>


## Nothing is “wrong” with you 
If you realized that you are avoidantly attached, that does not mean anything is wrong with you. It only shows you <span class='font-bold'>parts of yourself that need some healing.</span> 

Becoming aware of our own patterns is a huge step towards being fully healthy, but that does not mean you should beat yourself up over identifying a pattern you don’t find ideal. 

What I found most profound, is the realization that all of our <span class='font-bold'>behavior mechanisms and patterns stem from that little kid inside of us that learned to protect him/herself when their surroundings wouldn’t let them be safe. </span>

Once you develop this compassion for yourself, it will be so much easier to approach your healing journey in a <span class='font-bold'>gentle, loving way. Plus, it will make it a lot easier to have empathy and compassion with others once you see the scared child behind their actions and behaviors. </span>

Sending Love!
