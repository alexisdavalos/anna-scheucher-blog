This week is all about the Anxious, or also called the <span class='font-bold'>Preoccupied Attachment Style. </span>

To get a general introduction, or a closer look into the other Attachment styles, check out <a href="https://fullyholistic.com/posts/attachment-styles-introduction"><ins>my other posts</ins></a> 

## What is Anxious Attachment? 
When you are primarily anxiously attached, as you can probably guess, you are <span class='font-bold'>high on anxiety.</span> People with this attachment style <span class='font-bold'>crave closeness and intimacy.</span> Insecurity is a big topic in their relationships, they feel like others don’t want to get as close to them as they would like. 

<span class='font-bold'>Fear of abandonment </span>is a common theme with this attachment style and in relationships there can be worries that the partner <span class='font-bold'>does not love them. </span>

## Where does Anxious Attachment come from? 
As with all of the attachment styles, anxious attachment forms in early childhood. Inconsistent parenting behaviors are probably the <span class='font-bold'>biggest contributor to forming an anxious attachment style. </span>

When parents are slow or inconsistent in meeting their baby’s needs, like <span class='font-bold'>not picking them up when they cry,</span> it could develop into an anxious attachment later on in life. 

The main reason that the inconsistent behavior is triggering for the child, is that they become <span class='font-bold'>confused and insecure, </span>not knowing what behavior to expect. 

## What are the characteristics of Anxious Attachment? 
Common traits of people with predominantly anxious attachment are: 

<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Needy, <span class='font-bold'>wanting constant reassurance,</span> a desire to merge with their partner, which can in turn push them away</li>
<li>Insecure, <span class='font-bold'>fear of abandonment,</span> worries about rejection </li>
<li>Puts <span class='font-bold'>relationship over everything else </span></li>
<li>Sensitive to <span class='font-bold'>changes in mood </span>and action of partner, takes everything personally</li>
<li>Highly <span class='font-bold'>emotional, can be controlling </span></li>
<li>Not good at establishing <span class='font-bold'>personal boundaries </span></li>
<li>Unpredictable, likes to <span class='font-bold'>connect through conflict</span></li>
<li>Low <span class='font-bold'>self-worth and self-esteem </span></li>
<li>Overly <span class='font-bold'>dependent on a partner to meet their needs </span></li>
<li>Difficulty <span class='font-bold'>trusting others </span></li>
</ul>

## How can you prevent an anxious attachment style? 

To prevent anxious attachment in your child, you, as a parent, can help the most by <span class='font-bold'>consistently responding to your child’s needs </span>in loving ways. 

This way, the child can <span class='font-bold'>predict what will happen when they are in distress. </span>

## How can you heal from an anxious attachment style? 
If you can see yourself in the description of anxious attachment, you might ask yourself what to do now. 

Like all attachment styles, anxious attachment stems from childhood. This is why <span class='font-bold'>Inner Child Healing </span>can be a massive help in revovering from anxious attachment. Finding the <span class='font-bold'>roots of your anxiety and understanding your own behavior </span>will be a tremendous part in healing. 

Further, it will be helpful to learn <span class='font-bold'>how to trust yourself.</span> Being able to rely on yourself as opposed to depending entirely on other people is key. 

Seeking out a <span class='font-bold'>therapist or coach</span> is always a good idea, when healing alone seems overwhelming. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to <a class="text-gray-700  font-bold hover:underline hover:text-blue-500 duration-200 transition-colors" href="mailto:ascheucher.healing@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">contact me</a>. 

With this coaching, you can learn how to <span class='font-bold'>regulate your own emotions in healthy ways.</span> Self-soothing is a big part of anxious attachment, as it will teach you how to be okay, no matter what. This way you will not feel as <span class='font-bold'>dependent on other people. </span>

## Final thoughts 
No matter which attachment style you predominantly have at the moment, you are okay, and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Attachment styles are <span class='font-bold'>learned behaviors that kept us safe </span>in the past, but when the need for them is over, they can be <span class='font-bold'>unlearned. </span>

Moving towards a more secure attachment style is ultimately the goal, and it is completely normal if you feel like you need some support with that. Seek out a therapist or <a class="text-gray-700  font-bold hover:underline hover:text-blue-500 duration-200 transition-colors" href="mailto:ascheucher.healing@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">email</a> me with the subject line “attachment styles”.
