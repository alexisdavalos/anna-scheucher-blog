A trend of drinking green water has been rummaging all over social media the past few weeks. Chlorophyll water - what is it and what is the hype all about?

Tiktok and Instagram users from all over the world have been swearing by Chlorophyll water for clearer skin, better body odor and as an aid in losing weight. I did some research to see if jumping on that trend would be worth it, and to find out what that green water even is.

## What is Chlorophyll?

Chlorophyll - you might remember that word from a biology lesson back in middle school. Chlorophyll is the substance that gives plants their green color. It is also one of the main components in photosynthesis (the process of turning sunlight into energy). So far so good. But why would Chlorophyll help us humans?

## The benefits of Chlorophyll

According to a variety of studies, Chlorophyll may be beneficial for skin conditions, body odors, wound healing, as well as fighting certain kinds of cancer! Here is a list of benefits, proven by studies:

<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Anti-Aging (as a topical treatment - find the study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4966572/"><ins>here</ins></a>) 
<li>Acne treatment (as a topical treatment - <a href="https://jddonline.com/articles/dermatology/S1545961615P0589X"><ins>see the study</ins></a>)
<li>Blood deficiency disorders (for example anemia- <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-pilot-study-on-wheat-grass-juice-for-its-and-on-Chauhan/73f2bb7c0b1129b5da66ca284eb2294d956fa9d2?p2df"><ins>the study</ins></a> conducted was not done with Chlorophyll in itself, but with wheatgrass juice, which is very high in chlorophyll) 
<li>Deodorant properties (this one I found on numerous sources - Chlorophyll is said to be a strong inner deodorant, meaning it will reduce your smell of sweat, as well as bad breath over time! One of the studies can be found <a href="https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.1980.tb00124.x"><ins>here</ins></a>)
<li>Wound healing (according to some <a href="https://www.americanjournalofsurgery.com/article/0002-9610(47)90287-0/fulltext"><ins>studies</ins></a> done in the 1940s and 1950s, Chlorophyll may  aid in wound healing, as well as fighting off infections) 
<li>Cancer (numerous studies found that it may help with preventing or slowing cancer growth - find the study <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01635581.2015.990573?scroll=top&needAccess=true&"><ins>here</ins></a>)
</ul>

Now, these are all proven benefits of Chlorophyll. While scrolling through social media, I read a number of different claims, that may be true, have not been proven by science to this day, however. These benefits include:

<ul class="list-disc">
<li>Weight loss
<li>Hunger suppressant (similar to coffee) 
<li>More energy 
<li>More focus 
<li>Regular bowel movements 
<li>Better digestion
</ul>

Now, how much of this is placebo and how much is actually a direct consequence of Chlorophyll, I don’t know, but after trying it out myself for about two weeks now, I can say that my skin definitely cleared up and I seem to have more energy.

This can be a direct effect of drinking more water, though, so I can’t say for 100% whether this green pigment is doing all the work.

## The downsides of Chlorophyll

Before you run out and get your own bottle of liquid Chlorophyll, there are some downsides to it that should be duly noted.

According to a number of dermatologists, Chlorophyll could, in fact, be quite dangerous.

In a Youtube video, dermatologist Dr Dray talks about the possible risks of Chlorophyll. There is a possibility that Chlorophyll may cause photosensitivity in certain people. What that means, is essentially a sensitivity to light which in turn is a skin condition that causes redness and blistering. When we believe what this doctor says, simply stopping the consumption of chlorophyll may not solve the problem and it could take months to get back to a normal, healthy skin.

You can watch the video here:

But this condition is mostly due to an over-consumption of the green pigment. Chlorophyll in and of itself is not evil. In fact, we consume it almost every day, when we eat green plants and vegetables.

## My experience with Chlorophyll

After carefully reviewing all the information, I decided to give it a try myself.

For my personal consumption, I choose to drink one glass of it a day, usually first thing in the morning. That way I ensure not to overdo it and it gives me the habit of drinking a big glass of water right off the bat, which is always a plus :)

Chlorophyll seems to differ slightly in taste, depending on which brand you get. Most people report either a very earthy taste, or a very minty one.

The one I got definitely has a minty note to it. After getting used to the taste, I now love it in the mornings, because it feels like it’s cleaning every bit of not-so-fresh breath out of my system after a night’s sleep.

The first time I tried it, a slight wave of nausea hit me. I read online that this can be very normal, especially when the body is not used to this supplement yet. The nausea passed after about an hour, and ever since then I’ve had no complications.

As I mentioned above, after about two weeks of drinking one glass of Chlorophyll a day, my skin seems to have cleared up. It is hard for me to fully give credit to the green pigment, though, as the clear skin might very well be a direct effect of drinking 32oz (1L) of water first thing in the morning and continuing to drink more water throughout the day.

As for body odor, it might be too early to talk about the benefits of that. What I can say, is that I have not experienced a day of having any sort of strong odor, but that may just be my personal hygiene :)

A big benefit advertised on social media seems to be better digestion. After catching a stomach bug in Ecuador the first week after trying Chlorophyll, it’s a bit hard to comment on that. Ever since recovering from the virus, however, my digestion has been very regular. I will have to use it a bit longer to be able to have a proper opinion on the matter.

## Conclusion

So, is Chlorophyll the big life savior, the new superfood, the perfect addition to anybody’s life?

Probably not, but there may be some benefits in it for you.

As with a lot of hypes and trends, products tend to get glorified. Chlorophyll may bring some benefits to your life, but it probably won’t be the life-changing, amazing, mind-blowing product it is said to be.

As it is found in all green vegetables and plants, upping the intake of those will probably give you very similar benefits to drinking liquid Chlorophyll.

If you choose to try it out yourself, consider consulting a doctor for proper dosage for your body, or simply keep in mind the possible risks, and therefore keep the dosage relatively low at first.

I hope this post gave you some insight on this new hype, and I’d love to hear about your experiences with Chlorophyll!
